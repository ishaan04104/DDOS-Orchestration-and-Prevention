# DDoS Mitigation Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of denial-of-service (DoS) and clickjacking attacks, as well as the mitigation strategies using various tools and techniques.

## Installation and Setup Instructions
1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Kali Linux
   - Ubuntu
   - Scapy
   - tcpdump
   - Snort
   - Node.js (for the DoS attack simulation)

## Usage Instructions
1. Attackers Side:
   - Run the DDoS attack scripts in the `attackers_side` directory.
2. Defenders Side:
   - Configure Snort using the instructions in the `defenders_side` directory.
   - Run the Scapy-based Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) script.
3. DDoS Attack Simulation:
   - Run the server.js file in the `dos_attack_simulation` directory.
   - Execute the dos_attack.py script to initiate the DDoS attack.
4. Clickjacking and Phishing:
   - Open the `fake_movie_page.html` file in a web browser.
   - Observe the clickjacking and phishing techniques demonstrated.

## Demonstration and Mitigation Strategies
Detailed information about the demonstration and mitigation strategies can be found in the project documentation.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu
- Scapy
- tcpdump
- Snort
- Node.js
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Express.js

## Modules and Architecture
The project is divided into the following modules:
